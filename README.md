All credit goes to the original creators. I only merged them to avoid conflicts, tested and did some small improvements to fit my taste.

 - [Havoc Mod Pack](http://www.avorion.net/forum/index.php/topic,3753.0.html) | LordHavoc

[Havoc Mod Pack] includes:
 - Salvaging Turrets - Higher DPS, Longer Range, Thicker Beam, Faster turret rotation, Cost fixed(so that dps doesn't make em too expensive)
 - Turrets & Upgrade merchants sell more items
 - Salvage fighters have longer range
 - Custom Fighters - I've used the commands package with some old code that I got working (in one of my older posts) so that you can make your own custom fighters.
